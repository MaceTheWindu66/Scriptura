# Scriptura  

Scriptura is a ***work in progress*** mobile app which will allow you deeper insights into the ancient Hebrew and Greek texts of which the Bible is comprised of. 

## Translation Credits  

The only translation used by this application is the World English Bible (WEB), which is an open source translation of the English Bible. Plans are being made for more translations in the future, however, for licensing and copyright reasons, Scriptura **only** uses the WEB translation at this time.  

GitHub repository where the English translation resides is available here: https://github.com/seven1m/open-bibles
